# Product Overview

This is a barebones Django web application designed as a "Getting Started" template for Python development on Heroku. It serves as a minimal example demonstrating:

- Basic Django web framework setup
- Heroku deployment configuration
- Database integration (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL on Heroku)
- Static file serving with WhiteNoise
- Production-ready WSGI configuration with Gunicorn

The application includes a simple "hello" app with basic views and a Greeting model for database demonstration. It's intended as a starting point for developers learning Django deployment patterns or building new web applications.
