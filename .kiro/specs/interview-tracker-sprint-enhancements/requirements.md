# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses critical enhancements to the interview question and answer tracker application for the upcoming one-week sprint. The focus is on completing core CRUD functionality for both questions and answers, fixing existing issues with the single question view, and ensuring responsive design across all templates. The application already has a solid foundation with Django models, authentication, and basic views implemented.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Single Question View Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view an individual question alongside all related answers with proper STAR response rendering, so that I can study different approaches to answering interview questions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to a question detail page THEN the system SHALL load the page without errors or performance issues
2. WHEN the page displays answers THEN STAR responses SHALL be rendered differently from basic text responses with clear visual distinction
3. WHEN a user views the question detail THEN the system SHALL show the question title, body, tags, and metadata clearly
4. WHEN answers are displayed THEN each answer SHALL show the answer type, author, creation date, and appropriate preview content
5. WHEN a user has their own answer THEN it SHALL be highlighted separately from other users' answers
6. IF there are no answers THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state with call-to-action

### Requirement 2: Question Create Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new interview questions, so that I can build my personal collection of questions to practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the question creation page THEN the system SHALL display a form with title, body, tags, and visibility fields
2. WHEN a user submits a valid question form THEN the system SHALL create the question and redirect to the question detail page
3. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retain user input
4. WHEN a question is created THEN it SHALL be associated with the current user as the owner
5. WHEN a user creates a question THEN the system SHALL set appropriate default values for status and timestamps

### Requirement 3: Question Update Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my existing questions, so that I can improve or correct the content over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the edit page for their own question THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with existing data
2. WHEN a user submits valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the question and redirect to the question detail page
3. WHEN a user tries to edit another user's question THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retain user input
5. WHEN a question is updated THEN the system SHALL update the modified timestamp

### Requirement 4: Question Delete Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete my own questions, so that I can remove questions I no longer need from my collection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates question deletion THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the question and all associated answers
3. WHEN a user tries to delete another user's question THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
4. WHEN a question is deleted THEN the system SHALL redirect to the questions list with success message
5. WHEN deletion is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the question detail page without changes

### Requirement 5: Answer Create Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create answers to interview questions using either STAR method or basic text format, so that I can practice and refine my responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the answer creation page THEN the system SHALL display the question context and answer type selection
2. WHEN a user selects STAR format THEN the system SHALL display separate fields for Situation, Task, Action, and Result
3. WHEN a user selects basic format THEN the system SHALL display a single text area for the response
4. WHEN a user submits a valid answer THEN the system SHALL create the answer and redirect to the question detail page
5. WHEN a user already has an answer for a question THEN the system SHALL redirect to edit mode instead of create
6. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and retain user input

### Requirement 6: Answer Update Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my existing answers, so that I can improve my responses based on practice and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the edit page for their own answer THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the form with existing data
2. WHEN a user changes answer type THEN the system SHALL handle the conversion appropriately
3. WHEN a user submits valid changes THEN the system SHALL update the answer and redirect to the question detail page
4. WHEN a user tries to edit another user's answer THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
5. WHEN an answer is updated THEN the system SHALL update the modified timestamp

### Requirement 7: Answer Delete Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to delete my own answers, so that I can remove responses I no longer want to keep.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates answer deletion THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN a user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the answer and redirect to the question detail page
3. WHEN a user tries to delete another user's answer THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error message
4. WHEN deletion is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the previous page without changes
5. WHEN an answer is deleted THEN the system SHALL display a success message

### Requirement 8: Responsive Design Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work seamlessly on mobile devices and desktop screens, so that I can practice interview questions anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application on mobile devices THEN all templates SHALL display properly without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN navigation elements are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be accessible and properly sized for touch interaction
3. WHEN forms are displayed on mobile THEN input fields SHALL be appropriately sized and keyboard-friendly
4. WHEN cards and content blocks are displayed THEN they SHALL stack appropriately on smaller screens
5. WHEN the application is viewed on desktop THEN it SHALL utilize available space effectively without excessive whitespace
6. WHEN interactive elements are displayed THEN they SHALL have appropriate touch targets on mobile devices
